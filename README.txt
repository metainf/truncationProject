====================
Overview
====================

This program allows for the display of, rotation of,
and repeatable truncation of five regular polyhedra
(tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and
icosahedron).

====================
Instructions
====================

When using the "Select and truncate" tool, click on
the vertex or edge that you wish to truncate. When
it is selected, it will become blue, and the truncation
slider and button will became usable. Use the slider
to select the percentage to truncate by, and click the
"Truncate" button to perform the truncation.

When using the "Rotate" tool, click and drag the mouse
to rotate the polyhedron.

To change polyhedra, select a new polyhedron from the
drop-down list. If the current polyhedron is selected
from the list, it will be reset to its original state.

HOTKEYS
Spacebar: Switch tools
R: Reset the current polyhedron
Scroll Wheel (Mouse): Zoom in or out
Arrow Keys: Rotate the polyhedron
